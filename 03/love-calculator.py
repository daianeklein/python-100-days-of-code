# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers 
# to make a 2 digit number.

# print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
# name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
# name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

# nome1 = name1.lower()
# name2 = name2.lower()



count_first_name = 0
count_second_name = 0
# for i in name1:
#     if i in 'true love':
#         count_first_name += 1

# for j in name2:
#     if j in 'true love':
#         count_second_name +=1

nomes = 'daianeJuliana'
nomes = nomes.lower()
t = nomes.count('j')
print(t)
